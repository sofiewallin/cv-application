# Portfolio and CV

A personal portfolio and resume website built with TypeScript, HTML and Sass. This is part of a school assignment where I'm learning how to build a REST API with PHP and consume it with JavaScript/Typescript.

## The website

The website was developed object-oriented with TypeScript. The separate REST API:s public routes are consumed by the website using TypeScript and Fetch API. Webpack was used to bundle all the TypeScript code and allow use of Sass for styling etc.

## Project with three parts

This website is part of a school assignment that has been developed in three separate parts. One REST API, one admin website with login to administrate it and a public website to read data from it.

These repositories holds the rest of the project:

- REST API: https://github.com/sofiewallin/cv-rest-api
- Admin website: https://github.com/sofiewallin/cv-admin
